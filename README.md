👋 Hi, I’m Jan Paczkowski (@johnusz)

👀 I’m interested in everything that can be done with help of a computer (ie. programming, game dev, filmmaking, photography)

🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript frameworks (React, Express), but also Dart and Flutter

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small and medium-sized Flutter Projects

📫 You can reach me via e-mail: jan.paczkowski@outlook.com

Thanks for checking in on my profile, have a nice day 😉
