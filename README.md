👋 Hi, I’m Jan Paczkowski (@johnusz)

👀 I’m interested in everything that can be done with help of a computer (ie. programming, gaming, filmmaking, photography)

🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript frameworks (React, Express), but also Dart and Flutter

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small and medium-sized Flutter Projects

📫 You can reach me via e-mail: johnusz@icloud.com 

Thanks for checking on my profile, have a nice day :3
